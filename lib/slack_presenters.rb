    <<~MSG
      You can use the slash command `#{slash_command}` to award Spiderman Points to your friends!

      Specify who you'd like to award a Spiderman Point to and why, like this:
      ```
      #{slash_command} @uncle_ben for teaching me about power AND responsibility.
      ```

      Or this:
      ```
      #{slash_command} @jj_jameson because he always publishes the best pictures of Spiderman!
      ```

      Or if you wanna be vague, just go ahead and leave the reason off. That's fine.
      ```
      #{slash_command} @bonesaw
      ```

      Note that you can, and _should_ use the auto-completed username you get by starting with `@` and typing from there.



      There are also a few subcommands:

      ```
      recent:     Display the 10 most recent Spiderman Points.
      scoreboard: Display how many Spiderman Points everyone has given.
      help:       See this same message. Again.
      ```

        You can use the slash command `#{slash_command}` to award Spiderman Points to your friends!

        >>> *Usage*

        Specify who you'd like to award a Spiderman Point to and why, like this:
        ```
        #{slash_command} @uncle_ben for teaching me about power AND responsibility.
        ```

        Or this:
        ```
        #{slash_command} @jj_jameson because he always publishes the best pictures of Spiderman!
        ```

        Or if you wanna be vague, just go ahead and leave the reason off. That's fine.
        ```
        #{slash_command} @bonesaw
        ```

        Note that you can, and _should_ use the auto-completed username you get by starting with `@` and typing from there.



        *There are also a few subcommands:*

        ```
        recent:       Display the 10 most recent Spiderman Points.
        scoreboard:   Display how many Spiderman Points everyone has given.
        opt <in|out>: Opt in or out of receiving Spiderman Points.
        help:         See this same message. Again.
        ```

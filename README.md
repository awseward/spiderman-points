Spiderman Points!!!

### Dev Quickstart

```sh
# Clone and cd into the repo

bundle install
./scripts/watch.sh

# It should print out some local address (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:4567). You'll
# find a "fake" slack console/REPL sort of thing at `/dev/slash_command`
# (navigate in your browser) which you can use for quick feedback.
```
